# Waste Classification Using Deep Learning

## Project Type
Major Project
## Description
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify waste images into
**Organic** and **Recyclable** categories. The trained deep learning model predicts the
waste type from an input image.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Deep Learning (CNN)
- Google Colab

## Dataset
Publicly available waste image dataset (Organic & Recyclable).

## How to Run
1. Upload the trained model file (.h5)
2. Upload a waste image
3. Run the prediction cell in the notebook

## Output
- Organic (O)
- Recyclable (R)

## Note
This project was developed as a **Major Project during the B.Tech Data Science

Note: The trained model file is not uploaded due to GitHub file size limits.
The model can be shared separately if required.
